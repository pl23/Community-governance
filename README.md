# Decentralized & Community-voting-platform Data Framework

This project aims to create a decentralized and community-governed framework for managing and curating data.  The core principle is community ownership: all aspects of the framework's development, governance, and data curation will be controlled by the community through a built-in voting system.

## Project Vision

We envision a platform where data is not controlled by any single entity but is instead a shared resource governed by the community that uses it. This framework provides the tools and processes for achieving this vision, starting with a general data management system and potentially expanding to specialized data domains in the future.

## Key Features

*   **Blockchain Integration:** All data changes, including additions, deletions, updates, and even changes to the trust system itself, are immutably recorded on a public blockchain. This ensures transparency, auditability, and data integrity.
*   **Community Governance:** A built-in voting system empowers the community to make all decisions related to the framework and the data it contains.  This includes:
    *   Data curation (adding, deleting, updating data points).
    *   Modifying the framework's code, documentation, and guidelines.
    *   Defining and updating the trust system.
*   **Trust-Weighted Voting:** Votes are weighted based on a trust value associated with each user.  The community defines and manages the trust algorithm.
*   **Open Source & Non-Commercial:** The framework is released under a non-monetizable open-source license, ensuring free access for research and non-commercial use.
*   **Extensible & Adaptable:** The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing it to be adapted to different data types and research needs.  It is also being designed as a plug-in for other version control systems to extend its use to other facets of collaborative work.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

This project is in its early stages.  Here's how you can get involved:

1.  **Explore the Repository:** Familiarize yourself with the code, documentation, and existing issues.
2.  **Set Up Your Development Environment:** Follow the instructions in the `DEVELOPMENT.md` file (when available) to set up your development environment.  This project heavily relies on Python, and a `.venv` (virtual environment) will be provided for dependency management. Initially, this `.venv` will be intentionally left blank, allowing the community to collaboratively define the required dependencies.
3.  **Contribute:**  See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (when available) for guidelines on how to contribute code, documentation, or other improvements.

## Community Governance (Voting & Updates)

The framework is governed by the community through a built-in voting system.  All changes, including changes to the framework itself, are subject to community review and approval.

1.  **Submitting Proposals:**  Any community member can submit a proposal for a change.  Proposals must be clear, well-justified, and (for code changes) accompanied by the relevant code.  Initially, GitHub Issues/Discussions will be used for proposals.
2.  **Voting:** Registered users can cast their votes (yes/no/abstain) on proposals.
3.  **Trust-Weighted Votes:** Votes are weighted based on the trust value of the voters.  The trust algorithm is itself defined and updated by the community.
4.  **Proposal Approval:**  A proposal is approved if it receives a sufficient number of weighted "yes" votes.
5.  **Implementation:**  Approved changes are implemented by designated maintainers (initially the author) until the community governance process is fully established.

## Trust System

The trust system is a crucial component of the community governance model.  It allows the community to assess the trustworthiness of data and votes.

1.  **Community-Defined Algorithm:** The algorithm for calculating and updating trust values is defined by the community and implemented in a publicly accessible Python file within this repository.
2.  **Trust Records:**  Each user and each data point has an associated "trust record" storing its trust value.
3.  **Updating the Trust System:**  Changes to the trust algorithm and individual trust records are subject to the same voting process as other framework changes.

## Author's Note & Disclaimer

The current author of this project (me) serves as a *temporary* maintainer and decision-maker until the community governance and voting systems are fully implemented.  The long-term goal is to transition all control and ownership of the project to the community.  All decisions made by the author during this initial phase are intended to bootstrap the project and facilitate the transition to full community governance.  Once the voting system is in place, the author's role will shift to that of a regular contributor, and all future decisions will be made through community consensus.
